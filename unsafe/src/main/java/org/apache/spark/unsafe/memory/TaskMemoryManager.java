/**
 * Manages the memory allocated by an individual task.
 * <p>
 * Most of the complexity in this class deals with encoding of off-heap addresses into 64-bit longs.
 * In off-heap mode, memory can be directly addressed with 64-bit longs. In on-heap mode, memory is
 * addressed by the combination of a base Object reference and a 64-bit offset within that object.
 * This is a problem when we want to store pointers to data structures inside of other structures,
 * such as record pointers inside hashmaps or sorting buffers. Even if we decided to use 128 bits
 * to address memory, we can't just store the address of the base object since it's not guaranteed
 * to remain stable as the heap gets reorganized due to GC.
 * <p>
 * Instead, we use the following approach to encode record pointers in 64-bit longs: for off-heap
 * mode, just store the raw address, and for on-heap mode use the upper 13 bits of the address to
 * store a "page number" and the lower 51 bits to store an offset within this page. These page
 * numbers are used to index into a "page table" array inside of the MemoryManager in order to
 * retrieve the base object.
 * <p>
 * This allows us to address 8192 pages. In on-heap mode, the maximum page size is limited by the
 * maximum size of a long[] array, allowing us to address 8192 * 2^32 * 8 bytes, which is
 * approximately 35 terabytes of memory.
