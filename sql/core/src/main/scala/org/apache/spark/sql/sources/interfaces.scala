   * be put here.  For example, user defined output committer can be configured here
   * by setting the output committer class in the conf of spark.sql.sources.outputCommitterClass.
   *
   * Note that the only side effect expected here is mutating `job` via its setters.  Especially,
   * Spark SQL caches [[BaseRelation]] instances for performance, mutating relation internal states
   * may cause unexpected behaviors.
